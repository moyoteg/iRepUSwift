- [ ] It's up to you to decide on things like features.
- [ ]  You have 72 hours from the time you start to when you should submit your solution.
- [ ]  It doesn't have to be feature complete,
- [ ]  but it should compile and run. 
- [ ] Your submission should include full, buildable source code. 
- [ ] Please specify what features you implemented 
- [ ] and what known issues (deficiencies) remain in the app.
